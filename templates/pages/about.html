            <h3>Our story</h3>
            <p>New Dimension Towers Offers exact fit OEM style towers specifically for your boat. Our towers are indivividually designed to each model boat for optimum fit and performance. NDT also offers a hybrid tower for boats we do not currently have a pattern for. Our hybrid tower offers adequete strength and performance with the ability to adjust to the width of your specific boat.</p>
            
            <p>Our founder, Wayne Hartford, has been in the tower business for many years designing and building towers for boat manufacturers such as Mastercraft, Moomba, Supra, Sea Ray and many others. As a matter of fact, Wayne was the first to design a tower with rails that followed the contour of the windshield, giving it a “wrap around” effect. His innovation, evident on the Mastercraft Zero Flex Flyer tower, still leaves the competition scratching their heads. Wayne’s philosophy is that a tower should enhance the beauty and style of the boat rather than hinder it with a poorly fitted product. After operating a successful OEM tower business for several years, Wayne sold his company and turned his attention to the aftermarket industry. He discovered that there was a great need for exact-fit OEM style towers for older boats. When the OEM tower business started in 1998, older boats were not supported, leaving these boat owners without options for factory-fit towers. The only alternative was to buy a “universal-fit” or so-called “custom-fit” tower where the boat owner provides critical dimensions. That’s like letting your barber perform heart surgery; no thanks! Wayne’s solution was to take each boat on an individual basis and actually design each tower to fit the lines and style of the boat. The mounting system is engineered for structural integrity giving it the look and strength of an OEM product. The end result of these efforts is a tower that is easy to install because it actually fits your deck. It is also pleasing to the eye and safe for you and your family to enjoy for many years.</p>
            <p>As you can imagine, this has been a painstaking, labor-intensive process that has taken several years to accomplish. In fact, it is an ongoing process as New Dimension Towers continually adds more boats to their line-up. Our goal is to give you, the customer, the finest product available at a price you can live with. We guarantee, in writing, that if you are not completely satisfied, we will give you your money back. Now that’s something to get up in the air about!</p>

            <h3>Our Process</h3>
            <p>We start the design process by getting the boat we want to prototype into the shop. Each tower is patterned using the actual boat which allows us to design a tower that perfectly fits the lines and style of the boat. Custom billet alluminum feet are then painstakingly designed to fit the exact profile of the boat where the feet mount, ensuring a tight fit that doesn't stress or crack the gel coat. The profile is then accurately machined into the billet using a CNC milling maching. Every exact fit tower we offer goes through this process, and much more, before we can finally replicate it over and over without the need of the actual boat.</p>

                <p class="review-text">This tower made an old boat new again. The tower fit beautifully on my older-model Bayliner – it looks great! It also makes wakeboarding far more enjoyable for my family – my sons and I are getting much higher out of the water and having a great time. We also use the boat much more often than we did before. I also went back to add some speakers and lights which really set the whole thing off and are a lot of fun out on the water. I couldn’t have asked for more. – Ben P.</p>

                <h3 class="review-name">Worth the wait and effort!</h3>
                <p class="review-text">It took a while to get the tower, but it was well worth the wait! The fit and finish is on par with Zero-Flex and the bolt points are just as sleek. I called New Dimension Towers directly for some advice and they were great. I’m fairly handy with tools, etc., and still found this challenging. I put mine on a 1999 ProStar – the difficult part was the mounting of the backing plates, I had to do a lot of it by feel. Just be patient and you will be rewarded with an awesome tower. - Mike</p>

                <p class="review-text">Had the tower installed on my 2001 Mastercraft ProStar 190. It’s tight! It’s a dead ringer for the factory Zero-Flex tower for half the price. Pimped it out with a Mako 6 light bar. Now we are lighting up the night. New Dimension hand makes each tower specifically for your boat. If you need a tower this is the only way to go. - Bruce C.</p>
